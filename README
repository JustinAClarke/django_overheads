## Django Overheads

### Problem

At church's Leaders, Pastors, and event organises think that the people on the tech desk can use any file,
 or any style of data and present that at the drop of a hat in the heat of the moment in 30 seconds.
Many people do not understand that with overheads / data / words / VPS, requires time and testing and that files have specific requirements,
 and limitations.
Ie.
 * Most computers these days do not have disk drives, and so we are unable to play DVD's even if it is just a 2 minute promo video.
 * Most projectors these days are in 16x9 and that when you display a powerpoint of photo it will look terrible if it is 4x3.
 * If there is sound with the video, that will have to be tested through the sound desk, as every video can be different volumes,
 or the compter may be muted.
 * Not every compter can play the same files types, "avi" is difficult to play on MacOS, on the default player.
 * Some presentation software are unable to control powerpoints depending on the host Operating system,
 Pro Presentor on MacOS (due to Microsoft removing Powerpoint control API's, to allow external softwar to control powerpoints),
 so with this you require to export the slides to images, then import them into ProPresentor. This takes time.
 * Lots of people will arrive either right before the service starts or during the service with a USB or dvd asking to play it,
  for the sermon, or right now, for that person talking NOW.

### Solution

Build a Web based system, that allows users to submit files (video, images, powerpoint files), that will then get converted to the correct specifications or return to the submitter, to fix.
Limit the submission times, and allow a cleaner and less stressfull workflow.
